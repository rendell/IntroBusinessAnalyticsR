## Review of experience

## Code example
```{R eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE, error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
library(ggrepel)

data_apps <- tribble(
  ~application, ~business_capability, ~ease_of_learning, ~trend, ~cost,   
  "R",          10,                   4,                 10,     "Free",
  "Python",     7,                    4,                 10,     "Free",
  "Excel",      4,                    10,                7,      "Low",
  "Tableau",    6,                    7,                 6,      "Low",

```{R eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE, error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

  "Why R? Tools like Excel, Tableau, PowerBI are easier to learn, but have lower ",
  "Business Capability. Tools like Python, SAS, and Matlab have high ",
  "Data Science Capability, but lack the visualization and interactive ",
  "application tools needed for business. R has the best data science, visualization, ",
  " and interactive tools plus it's free!"

## Shiny
Shiny is a framework for creating interactive web applications that are powered by R. Shiny is a major consulting area for us as four of five assignments involve building a web application using shiny. It’s not only powerful, it enables non-data scientists to gain the benefit of data science via interactive decision making tools.

## Let's take a short break...


## the Heart
R users can be found all over the web. A few of the popular hangouts are:
*R-Bloggers
*rstats on Twitter
*The R Project for Statistical Computing group on LinkedIn

R-focused business conferences are gaining traction in a big way. Here are a few that we attend and/or will be attending in the future:

*EARL - Mango Solution’s conference on enterprise and business applications of R
*R/Finance - Community-hosted conference on financial asset and portfolio analytics and applied finance
*Rstudio Conf - Rstudio’s technology conference
*New York R - Business and technology-focused R conference

Meetups
A really cool thing about R is that many major cities have a meetup nearby. Meetups are exactly what you think: a group of R-users getting together to talk R. 

## What's the most practical way to acquire the skills and experience needed?
The best resources I have come across.

## Thank you
